HEIF for Android
======

A quick demo, to investigate the possibility and efficiency of HEIF soft encode/decode on Android platform.

Just a simple wrapper around of [libheif](https://github.com/strukturag/libheif) which use [libde256](https://github.com/strukturag/libde265) to handle decoding and [libx265](http://x265.org/) to handle the encoding.

Cross compiling tool is android-ndk-r17b standalone toolchain clang/clang++ and only `armeabi-v7a` is available for now. If you need more architectures support, [check here](https://github.com/WanghongLin/miscellaneous/blob/master/docs/libheif4Android.md) to see how to generate `libheif.so` step by step.

Remove all assembly implementation of x265 in order to avoid `TEXTREL` problem, might be faster if assembly for x265 is turned on, but I have no idea how to fix this `TEXTREL` problem.

The main and very simple JNI wrapper can be found at [heif_jni.cpp](libheif/src/main/cpp/heif_jni.cpp), accept input format rgba(can easily obtained from bitmap in Android) and yuv, produce output format is rgba which can be used easily to create a bitmap in Android.

__NOTE__: `libheif.so` include debug info, not stripped, its size can be smaller with debug info stripped if you are going to integrate inside your released product, and `x86` and `x86_64` architectures are not tested.

------

The encoded heif can be pull from device and open on macOS

```sh
$ adb pull /mnt/sdcard/output.heic
$ open output.heic
```
